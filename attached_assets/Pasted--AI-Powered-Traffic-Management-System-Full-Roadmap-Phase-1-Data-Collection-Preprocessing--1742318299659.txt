📌 AI-Powered Traffic Management System – Full Roadmap
🔹 Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (Week 1)
✅ Find a Dataset
Choose one based on your project needs:

Tabular Data (CSV-based)

India Traffic Dataset (Kaggle)
Government Open Data (Data.gov.in)
Traffic sensor data
Video-Based Data (CCTV Footage)

AI City Challenge (Surveillance Videos)
Berkeley DeepDrive Dataset (Dashcam)
YouTube Traffic Camera Footage
✅ Preprocess Data
For CSV-based data: Handle missing values, clean timestamps, normalize numerical features.
For Video-based data: Extract frames, label vehicle types, resize, and normalize images.
🔹 Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization (Week 2)
✅ Perform EDA
Analyze peak congestion hours.
Find correlations between congestion, weather, and time.
Identify patterns based on location and time of day.
✅ Create Visualizations
Heatmaps to show congestion trends.
Time-series plots for vehicle count variations.
Bar charts for peak-hour analysis.
🔹 Phase 3: Object Detection & Vehicle Counting (Week 3-4)
✅ Use OpenCV & YOLOv5 for Vehicle Detection
Train a YOLOv5 model for detecting cars, bikes, and buses.
Count vehicles in real-time using OpenCV.
Apply motion tracking for better accuracy.
✅ Implement Motion Tracking (Optional for better accuracy)
Use DeepSORT or OpenCV tracking algorithms to track vehicles across frames.
🔹 Phase 4: Traffic Prediction Model (Week 5-6)
✅ Build a Machine Learning Model
Use Time Series Forecasting (LSTMs, ARIMA, or Random Forest) to predict congestion.
Train the model on historical traffic data.
✅ Evaluate Model Performance
Use RMSE, MAE, and R² scores to check model accuracy.
🔹 Phase 5: Build a Streamlit Dashboard (Week 7-8)
✅ Create an Interactive Dashboard
Show live traffic updates with graphs and vehicle counts.
Add a congestion prediction feature.
✅ Deploy on GitHub & Share on LinkedIn
Upload project code to GitHub with meaningful commits.
Share a LinkedIn post with insights, challenges, and learnings.
